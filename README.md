# Social Media Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to provide insightful performance analysis of social media platforms using Astra DB for data storage and LangFlow for low-code process orchestration. The application is developed using Python APIs for backend operations and Streamlit for an interactive user interface (UI) and also providing custom dataset in the 'csv' format. It is designed as a qualification round test project, demonstrating robust technical and analytical capabilities.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites:
1. Create an Astra DB instance and a vector embedded collection with the dataset.
2. Create the complete flow in the LangFlow UI and get the required APIs and place it in the .env file. 
3. Python 3.8 or above installed.
4. Streamlit installed.

### Steps to Set Up:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mitrank/smh-social-media-performance-analysis.git
   cd smh-social-media-performance-analysis
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
